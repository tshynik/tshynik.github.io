# AFL-CIO, Labor Unions File Amicus Brief in Humanitarian Parole Supreme Court Case

> “The Trump administration’s attack against Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan immigrants who are here legally on humanitarian parole is an attack on all working people,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. “Our immigrant brothers, sisters and siblings from these nations came to the United States to flee danger at home, and while here have been legally working and contributing to our economy while supporting their families. Ripping them away from their families and homes is a grave injustice that will have harmful ripple effects across our workplaces, our industries, and our economy. We are proud to file this amicus brief alongside our affiliated unions representing workers in key American industries, including those like food processing and manufacturing that cannot function without the work of these immigrants. We call on the Supreme Court to reject the Trump administration’s effort to deport these valued members of our workplaces and communities.”
