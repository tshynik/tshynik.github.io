# Employees at Sesame Workshop Win Union Election Joining OPEIU Local 153

New York, NY — May 15, 2025 — Employees at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, voted 55-19 in an election run by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to certify their labor union, the Sesame Workers Union. The supermajority (74%) voted to join the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 153.

After Sesame Workshop attempted to cancel the election twice and tried to turn away eligible employees on election day, the election results mark a significant milestone for over 100 workers at Sesame Workshop. Workers represent a broad cross-section of the people who power Sesame Workshop’s impact—including early childhood education experts, fundraisers, facilities staff, producers, paralegals, and more. The newly formed union is committed to strengthening workplace collaboration, equity, and transparency in support of the organization’s educational mission.
