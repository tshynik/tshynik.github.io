1965

> Judy Mage, an emerging lesbian, leads eight thousand employees of New York City's Department of Welfare as they walk off their jobs in early January. The strike, initiated by the independent Social Service Employees Union in coaliÂ­tion with American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 371, defies state law and continues for twenty-eight days. Mage and eighteen other leaders from both unions are arrested, jailed, and released. Union members return to their jobs, and negotiations resume. A settlement in June breaks new ground on wages, reductions in case loads, and defined union rights for all municipal workers.
