# Jessie Lopez de la Cruz

Anniversary of her death was last week - 2 Sept 2013

In 1919, Jessie Lopez was born in Anaheim, California. Her family was poor enough that she began working in fruit and vegetable fields at five…

pruning vines, picking oranges, peas, beets, prunes, cotton, and grapes. She resided in Anaheim until she was 9 years old…. The depression years were tough on the Lopez family. In 1931 they became migrant workers again, often sleeping roadside in a tent.

While working in San Juan Capistrano in 1932, Jessie was asked to help translate during a strike of Mexican workers, as she had the best English of the workers, who were mostly Mexican. In 1938, she married another farmworker, Arnold de la Cruz, and they went on to have six children.

She continued as a farmworker for decades before becoming inspired to start organizing workers. She wouldn't become an organizer until she was in her 40s. Her husband, Arnold, began working with César Chávez and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in 1965. Meetings were held in the couple's home, and soon Jessie began to volunteer as well.

After the NFWA became the United Farm Workers (UFW), Jessie became the top recruiter in the union. She led or participated in a variety of actions, such as picketing stores, to advocate for the safety of Mexican American workers and against employer corruption and abuse.

In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some circumstances of being a female labor organizer. "It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people my age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, but they were not taking orders from women."[7] She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her "suggestion" to add women to the all-male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women's crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid-1960s and being asked by a white man "how do you say communists in Spanish?", she responded "Ustedes Ganaran" (You shall win), and the man went on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.[6]

UFW established its first hiring hall in 1968 and Jessie became the manager. Her tireless efforts led her to even more exposure and activity in organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, Central California Action Associates, California's Commission on the Status of Women.

Jessie worked to improve UFW as well. Her advocacy led the union to expand opportunities for women in leadership positions, despite strong opposition.

She retired from UFW in 1993 and spent her retirement working with California Rural Legal Assistance and her local Catholic charity. After she died in 2013, her biography was adapted into a television miniseries.
