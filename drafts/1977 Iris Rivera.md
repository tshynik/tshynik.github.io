Feb. 2, 1977: Chicago legal secretary Iris Rivera is fired for refusing to make coffee, sparking protests by secretaries across the metropolitan area.

This week marks the start of Women’s History Month. ...In 1977, a Chicago secretary named Iris Rivera triggered another legal reckoning over the intersection of gender and workers rights after she refused to make coffee for her office. 

Iris Rivera worked as a secretary at the Illinois State Appellate Defender’s Office in Chicago, a state government agency that provided appeal defense for impoverished defendants in criminal cases. On January 26th, 1977, the 35-year-old Rivera refused to brew coffee for her immediate boss, Attorney James Geis, and the rest of her 18-person office. 

Geis had circulated a memo updating the company policy, arguing that instead of taking turns brewing coffee – as had been the norm – Rivera was to consistently brew the pot. ...

Rivera refused out of hand. She did not drink coffee, and considered the task outside of her duties. Geis promptly fired Rivera, citing that she “refused to cooperate with other secretaries in fulfilling the responsibilities they have been assigned.” 

Rivera, however, was not going down without a fight. During her two-week notice period, she filed a discrimination complaint with the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission asking for reinstatement.

She also went to the press. “I can’t afford to lose my job. I’m a widow with three children, but there’s a principle involved,” she told the _Chicago Tribune_ on February 3rd. 

“State regulations don’t say anything about secretaries making coffee, and I don’t think the state is paying me to stop work and make it for others,” Rivera further explained to reporters. “Ordering secretaries to fix the coffee is carrying the role of homemaker too far.” 

...

The same day that Rivera filed her complaint, 40 secretaries appeared in front of her office to protest her firing. Protestors gave attorneys coffee grounds and a mocking pamphlet explaining how to operate a coffee maker. One step read, “Turn switch to on. This is the most difficult step, but, with practice, even an attorney can do it.” 

The protest was orchestrated by [Women Employed](https://womenemployed.org/), a fast-growing organization of women who worked in Chicago’s central Loop business district.

...

The pressure campaign worked. On February 28th, Geis’ boss, State Appellate Defender [Theodore Gottfried](https://www.iacdl.net/?pg=BioTheodoreGottfried), ruled to reinstate Rivera. 

Rivera told the press she hoped that her case would reverberate. “I was hoping he would rule in my favor,” she said. “I’ve talked to a lot of secretaries since this happened. Maybe they can refuse to do things that aren’t related to their jobs.”  

Rivera still had a difficult road ahead. She had a kidney condition, and was unable to immediately return to work. She checked in to Grant Hospital for three major surgeries between February and April.

...

Rivera continued her activism, rallying for more efficient disability pay after she waited months for hers to kick in. At one point she had $6 in her checking account. 

 She still managed to appear at a [May 14th Equal Rights Amendment rally](https://www.oakpark.com/2012/08/21/the-era-amendment-went-down-to-defeat-30-years-ago-time-for-a-look-back/) in Chicago, carrying an “ERA–Yes!” sign. 

And in late June 1977, Rivera returned to work. A new policy was in place: only those who consumed coffee would be required to brew, and they would take turns.

...

If Rivera had alienated some bosses, she had galvanized secretaries around the country – a group that made up around one-third of the American female labor force. 

Similar stories of protest soon emerged. In Iowa in October 1977, Diana Becker, who had been a secretary at the Waterloo Community School District’s administrative offices for the preceding ten years, also boycotted coffee brewing. “All the years I made it, I thought, ‘This is not right,’” Becker [told the _New York Times_ in a lengthy profile](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/28/archives/a-secretary-who-spurned-the-coffee-detail.html).   

...

And she echoed Rivera’s criticism that the coffee-brewing duties reflected other stereotypically female roles. “When I took typing and shorthand they never taught me how to make coffee,” Becker said. “If I’d wanted to do this type of thing, I would have applied for work at a restaurant. I can’t be a secretary and a waitress.”

Soon, broader think pieces suggested a new epoch in secretarial work. “Better think twice before asking your secretary to make coffee for you this morning,” read the start of a February 1978 _Wall Street Journal_ piece by labor reporter [Joann Lublin](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/joann-s-lublin). ....

**[labor reporter] Lublin collected some of the more ridiculous tasks executives had given their secretaries. A secretary for a senior partner at the prestigious Cleveland law firm Kelly, McCann & Livingstone, revealed that her boss made her carry around freshly-sliced carrots at all times. **

...

By the time of the _Wall Street Journal_ report, Women Employed – the organization that had rallied for Rivera – had recruited 820 paying members and secured $1.1 million in back pay and salary increases for women in Chicago. They had received a visit from President Carter’s Assistant Secretary of Labor, Donald Ellsburg, who promised “vigorous enforcement” of anti-discrimination law. 

Women Employed had also crafted national networks with groups of women professionals in other cities, like the [Cleveland Women Working](http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/OCLWHi0287.xml;chunk.id=bioghist_1;brand=default) and Nine-to-Five in Boston.
