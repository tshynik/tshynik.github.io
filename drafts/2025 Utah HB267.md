A coalition of Utah labor unions banded together to fight H.B. 267, "which was authored by out-of-state anti-worker think tanks. This bill was passed by the state legislature in February and severely weakens the rights of public sector workers to bargain for fair wages and safe working conditions."

But, good news! Organizers got to work and "submitted 320,000 signatures from voters calling for a vote to repeal the legislation." "The Utah lieutenant governor confirmed at the end of April that a coalition of unions have gathered enough signatures for a referendum to overturn state legislation restricting collective bargaining rights for public sector workers."


Utah lawmakers passed HB267 earlier this year after a back-and-forth with the major teachers' union that offered the prospect of a compromise version of the bill. That compromise was never adopted, however, and lawmakers moved forward with the version that strips public unions of their ability to collectively bargain with employers to negotiate wages, benefits and other worker protections.
