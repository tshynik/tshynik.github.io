**William George Meany** (August 16, 1894 – January 10, 1980) was an American [labor union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_union "Labor union") administrator for 57 years. He was important for the creation of the [AFL–CIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO "AFL–CIO") and served as the AFL–CIO's first president, from 1955 to 1979.

Meany, the son of a union plumber, became a plumber himself at a young age. He became a full-time union official 12 years later. As an officer of the [American Federation of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor "American Federation of Labor"), he represented the AFL on the [National War Labor Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_War_Labor_Board_(1942%E2%80%931945) "National War Labor Board (1942–1945)") during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). He served as president of the AFL from 1952 to 1955.

He proposed its merger with the [Congress of Industrial Organizations] (CIO) in 1952 and managed the negotiations until the merger was completed in 1955. He then served as president of the merged AFL–CIO for the next 24 years.

Termed Meany's "greatest achievement" by _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ magazine, the new federation had 15 million members. Only two million US workers were members of unions remaining outside the AFL–CIO.

Meany had a reputation for integrity and consistent opposition to corruption in the labor movement and strong [anti-communism] which led him to support the Vietnam war. He was one of the best known union administrators in the United States during the mid-20th century.

In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom], a major event in the history of the [civil rights movement] in the United States. Meany opposed AFL–CIO endorsement of the march. In an AFL–CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of the march was supported by only [A. Philip Randolph] of the [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters] the titular leader of the march. The AFL–CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march.  When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the [A. Philip Randolph Institute] to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Meany#cite_note-NYTObit-4)
