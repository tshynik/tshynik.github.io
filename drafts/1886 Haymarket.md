The Haymarket Martyrs' Monument commemorates the struggle to achieve the eight-hour workday and the 1886 rally in Haymarket Square that led to the hanging of four leaders of the fight for workers' rights.

On May 4, 1886 a group of workers gathered in Haymarket Square in Chicago to protest police brutality against strikers at the South Side McCormick Reaper Factory. At the conclusion of the meeting, police marched in and demanded an end to the gathering. An unknown assailant threw a bomb into the crowd, and police shots rang out. Several police officers and protestors were killed or wounded. Police later apprehended eight labor activists, four of whom would be executed.
