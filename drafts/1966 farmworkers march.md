A little bit of farmworker organizing context: 
In the early history of American agriculture, farmworkers experienced many failed attempts to organize agricultural laborers. In 1903, Japanese and Mexican farmworkers attempted to come together to fight for better wages and better working conditions. This attempt was ignored and disbanded when organizations, such as the American Federation of Labor, neglected to support their efforts, often withholding assistance on the basis of race.[6]

The small but energetic National Farm Labor Union, led by dynamic organizer Ernesto Galarza, found its efforts to create a lasting California farmworkers union in the 1940’s and 50’s stymied again and again by the growers’ manipulation of braceros.

The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), A fledgling union sponsored by the AFL-CIO, was led by Filipino-American organizer Larry Itliong, who lost three fingers in an accident in an Alaskan cannery, which earned him the nickname, "Seven Fingers."

Dolores Huerta created the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA) in 1960 to lobby politicians on farmworker issues, including public assistance access for migrant workers and Spanish-language ballots and driving tests. In 1962, she and César Chávez created the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA)

The NFWA had always been more than a union.
Indeed, the founders had consciously shied away from that title and offered many services beyond a typical labor organization. Chavez had organized the NFWA around the premise that the farm workers’ struggle was part of a much broader movement for civil rights.

March 17, 1966: Nearly 100 striking Mexican and Filipino farm workers - who had already been on strike against Delano grape growers for 6 months - begin a march from Delano to Sacramento, California. By April 11, when they reached the steps of the state capitol, 10,000 supporters had joined them.
A few months later, the two organizations representing the workers – the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and the National Farm Workers Association – joined to form a single union, out of which the United Farm Workers was born.
The AWOC and NFWA allied and transformed from workers' rights organizations into a union as a result of a series of strikes in 1965, when the most Filipino farmworkers of the AWOC in Delano, California, initiated a grape strike, and the NFWA went on strike in support. As a result of the commonality in goals and methods, the NFWA and the AWOC formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee on August 22, 1966.[3] This organization was accepted into the AFL-CIO in 1972 and changed its name to the United Farm Workers Union.[4]
