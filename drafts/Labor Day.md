# Labor Day

Labor Day is a federal holiday in the United States celebrated on the first Monday of September to honor and recognize the American labor movement and the works and contributions of laborers to the development and achievements of the United States.[1][2][3]

"Labor Day" was promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor, which organized the first parade in New York City in September 1882.

The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (which would later become the American Federation of Labor, or AFL) held a convention in Chicago in 1884, proclaiming “eight hours shall constitute a legal day’s labor from and after May 1, 1886.” As the chosen date approached, U.S. labor unions prepared for a general strike in support of the eight-hour day.

On May 1, 1886, more than 300,000 workers from 13,000 businesses walked out of their jobs across the country. Overall, the protests were peaceful, but that changed on May 3, 1886 where Chicago police attacked strikers. The next day a rally was planned at Haymarket Square to protest the killing and wounding of several workers by the police.

The speaker was winding down when a group of officers arrived to disperse the crowd. As the police advanced, someone who was never identified threw a bomb into their ranks. Chaos ensued, and at least seven police and eight civilians died.

In 1887, Oregon was the first state of the United States to make a September labor day an official public holiday. By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty states in the U.S. officially celebrated Labor Day.[4]

After the 1894 Pullman Strike, President Grover Cleveland officially declared the U.S. celebration of Labor Day as the first Monday in September, intentionally severing ties with the international worker’s celebration for fear that it would build support for communism and other radical causes.

More than 150 other countries celebrate International Workers' Day on May 1, the European holiday of May Day. May Day was chosen by the Second International of socialist and communist parties to commemorate the general labor strike in the United States and events leading to the Haymarket affair, which occurred in Chicago, Illinois, from May 1 – May 4, 1886.[5][6]
